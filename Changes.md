Fic submissions require a login. Art submissions don't, but you won't be able to manipulate your submissions without one. Art rounds and prelim rounds are both optional on a per-event basis.

I suspect that dealing with the vote distribution will take longer than other components, since a nice interface to the voting will take a bit of javascript magic. That said, the main algorithm for participant distributions is already written from earlier; it just needs a little wrapping to be more modular. 

The only thing that isn't trivial is the volunteer distribution. I'm still thinking about how I should handle that. Suggestions are welcome.
