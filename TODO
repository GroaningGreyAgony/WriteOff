# Schema changes

- Voting rounds should be a separate table, *..1 with events
- Role and UserRole should be removed. Add "admin" col to User.
- Remove Heat/Ban since they aren't used.
- Change most User relationships to being on Artist instead. The idea
  is that User is used just for authentication. Artist is the identity.
  This means that users should either have a way to mark an arist as
  their "primary" artist, or every resource needs an added artist field.
  For most things, the former seems more appropriate.
- Handle canonicalisation of user.name, user.email, and artist.name
