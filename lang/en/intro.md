# Introduction

The Writeoff is, at its most basic level, a fiction writing competition in which participants write stories from a prompt within a short time limit. Authors are kept anonymous to keep the competition about the stories, not the people who write them.

But the Writeoff is more than that. It’s also a community of writers honing their craft. Critiquing each other’s work has become a long-standing Writeoff tradition, and anonymity helps keep these critiques fair and unbiased. The combination of competition and peer review has proven a great way for writers to improve their skill.

Prompts are submitted and voted on by the community. Each user can submit a prompt any time before voting begins, which is 24 hours before the event starts. The prompt with the most votes becomes that round’s prompt.

Once a prompt is selected, the meat of the competition begins: writing. The word limit and time allotted depend on the competition's format. The current formats are&mdash;

* Minific &mdash; 400&ndash;750 words in 1 day
* Short Story &mdash; 2000&ndash;8000 words in 3 days

Once submissions close, voting begins. Anyone can vote, though in practise voting is mostly done by the participants. (For obvious reasons, participants can’t vote on their own stories.)

Voters are assigned stories from the competition to read and rank from best to worst. (What that means, exactly, is up to the voter.) [These rankings are then combined into a unified ranking](/faq#How-does-the-voting-algorithm-work), which is used to determine the winners.

There are usually two voting rounds. After each voting round, [the top ranking stories move on to the next round](/faq#How-many-entries-move-on-to-the-finals), while the others are eliminated. Once eliminated, stories have their authors revealed.

Once the voting rounds are finished, results are posted. The first, second, and third ranking stories receive gold, silver, and bronze medals respectively. Other miscellaneous awards are also dealt out.
