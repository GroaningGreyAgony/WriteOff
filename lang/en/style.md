# Formatting & Style Guide

## Style

To aid with author anonymity, the following style rules should be applied to all
submitted stories.

1. Paragraphs should be separated by a single blank line.
2. Scene breaks should be indicated by an [hr] in its own paragraph.
3. Weak scene breaks should be indicated by a blank paragraph, i.e, three blank lines.
4. Sentences should be separated by a single space.

### Example

	This is a sentence. Sentences have exactly one space between them.

	This is a new paragraph.

	[hr]

	There was a scene break just there.



	There was a weak scene break just there.

## Formatting

Stories can be formatted using BBCode. The following tags are supported:

	[hr]                          Horizontal rule
