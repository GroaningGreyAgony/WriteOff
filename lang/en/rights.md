# Content Rights

Disclaimer: This page does not constitute legal advice.

A lot of Writeoff participants are unclear of the rights associated with their work.
The following is an attempt to expain the consequence of submitting work to this website.

## Rights you grant this website

The [terms of service](/tos) say you grant us a license to publish any submitted work,
because publishing the submitted work is the point of this website, and we need a license to do that.
It also says you can't submit any work you don't have rights to, which should be fairly obvious.
To be clear, you still own your submitted work.
We just have a license to publish it.

## First publishing rights

If you want to sell your story, most publishers will want first publishing rights.
They want to be the only place where customers can get the story.
If customers can buy elsewhere&mdash;or even better, read it for free here&mdash;then you don't have much to sell.

Given that you've granted us a license to publish your work, and it's already been published, how exactly do you go about selling it?

## Deleting your work from this website

You can revoke the license granted to us by deleting your work. To do this, go to the [My Submissions](/user/me).
(Not currently possible. ETA: 25 Oc 2015.)

However, deleting the story outright may not be required.

The concern most publishers have is that their customers can obtain the work elsewhere.
The way most customers will go about doing this is searching the story's name on Google.
Fortunately, Google (and other well-behaved web crawlers) can be told that certain pages are not to be indexed.
So if you want to instead only make your work disappear from search engines, you can simply mark it as not to be indexed in the [My Submissions](/user/me) page.
(Not currently possible. ETA: 25 Oct 2015.)
