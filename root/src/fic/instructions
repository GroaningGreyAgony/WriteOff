Make sure your spacing is correct!

Paragraphs are separated by one (and ONLY one) blank line.



Weak scene breaks are done like aboveâ€”a blank paragraph. That means three blank lines.

Scene breaks are done with a horizontal rule on its own paragraph. Observe:

[hr]

Spacing that doesn't adhere to these rules may result in disqualification.
